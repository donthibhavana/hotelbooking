 Created a hotel booking website with Frontend: HTML, CSS, bootstrap, javascript, Backend: PHP, MySQL. The hotel booking application contains multiple pages like home, user sign, hotel booking, blog page, checkout page, and admin panel. Php is used to authenticate(register/sign-in) to the application. Once authenticated, users can see the available hotels, check their prices and reserve the hotel rooms. The admin can manage the hotel services.
